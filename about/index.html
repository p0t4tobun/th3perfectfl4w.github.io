    <h2>Hello, I'm Annie - a website developer in the San Francisco Bay Area.</h2>

    <p>A few things about me:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>I'm an IT Technical Associate at Kaiser Permanente and a Cal Poly SLO alumna (B.S. Computer Science).</li>
      <li>My experience is mostly in web dev, but I'm also interested in cybersecurity and devops/workflow management. I love being involved in the process of designing, coding, and seeing a website come to life, and I hope to continue to improve my skills and achieve my life goal of becoming a full-stack developer. <strong>To me, being a full-stack developer means understanding every major technology and its applications to the extent that you can clearly see the connections between each layer of the stack.</strong> Here's a good explanation of the web development stack if you're interested in what it encompasses: <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/full-stack-developer/" target="_blank">Being a Full Stack Developer (SitePoint)</a></li>
      <li>In my free time I enjoy gaming, EDM, and mixing drinks, though not necessarily in that order. ;)</li>
    </ul>
