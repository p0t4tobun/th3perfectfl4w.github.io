<p>I decided to try using a static site generator for my website. I'm very much a CMS person when it comes to building websites; I usually direct my website clients to WordPress for ease-of-use. In fact, up until yesterday, I was planning on using Drupal to manage my own site. However, I've realized that it is completely overkill to use a CMS for my portfolio.</p><!--end excerpt-->
<p>What is a static site generator? At its core, it's a framework that just chugs out static HTML pages based on templates and requires a "build" process, as opposed to dynamically generated content that originates from the server. Here's an informative SitePoint article that I stumbled upon that lists <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/7-reasons-use-static-site-generator/" target="_blank">7 Reasons to Use a Static Site Generator</a>.</p>
<p>I picked the static site generator Jekyll not only because it is a popular choice, but it's also designed to work seamlessly with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a> (public web pages for users, organizations, and repositories, that are freely hosted on GitHubâ€™s github.io domain or on a custom domain name of your choice). By committing a Jekyll-based site to a Github Pages repo, Github automatically deploys your site every time you push a commit.</p>
<p>I was able to rebuild my website (which was originally in PHP) in about a day using Jekyll. A static site generator is perfect for my website portfolio because I don't need to update it too frequently and it provides as much flexibility as a pure HTML site, without the hassle of updating the same sections on every page, such as the navigation. It basically accomplishes the same functionality that I got out of using PHP includes before, and instead of relying on a database, I get to use git to maintain versions of the site, which is great (I &lt;3 git). Since I don't require any form of input on my website, I really don't need to deal with the security hassles of a CMS either.</p>
