    <h2>Hello, I'm Annie - a website developer at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo.</h2>

    <p>A few things about me:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>I'm a full time software developer working for California Polytechnic State University and a freelance website developer.</li>
      <li>I'm always learning about a wide variety of computer-related topics, but I'm particularly interested in website development. I love being involved in the process of designing, coding, and seeing a website come to life, and I hope to continue to improve my skills and achieve my life goal of becoming a full-stack web developer. <strong>To me, being a full-stack developer means understanding every major technology and its applications to the extent that you can clearly see the connections between each layer of the stack.</strong> Here's a good explanation of the web development stack if you're interested in what it encompasses: <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/full-stack-developer/" target="_blank">Being a Full Stack Developer (SitePoint)</a></li>
      <li>I'm also an avid video gamer, when I can find time between work and other responsibilities. I play mostly FPS's and puzzle and/or music games. I'm trying to get into League of Legends as well, but we'll see how that goes. ;)</li>
